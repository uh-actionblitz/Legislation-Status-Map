<!--

  Hi! Thank you so much for adding an issue or requesting a feature from this legislative map. This will help us in improving the applicaiton further and making sure that people are aware about the status of the laws being created in their state.

  We only ask for very simple descriptions of the bug / feature add.

  • Abstract: In a short description, explain to us the issue you are experiencing or the feature you want to see.

  • More information: This is where you can expound on it! This will help  contributors in solving/building on your suggestion. Key questions to consider answering: what are the steps you need to take to replicate the bug or build on the feature, for bugs – how often are you experiencing it?

  For more info, please feel free to contact [techcreative.actionblitz@gmail.com](mailto:techcreative.actionblitz@gmail.com) for more info.
